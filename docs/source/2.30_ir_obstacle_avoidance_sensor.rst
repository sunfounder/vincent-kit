2.30 IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensor
===================================

**Overview**
----------------

In this lesson, you will learn how to use IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensor.
This module is commonly installed on the car and robot to judge the
existence of the obstacles ahead. Also it is widely used in hand held
device, water faucet and so on.

**Component Introduction**
-----------------------------
An IR Obstacle Sensor works in accordance with the infrared reflection
principle to detect obstacles. When there is no object, the infrared
receiver receives no signals; when there is an object ahead which blocks
and reflects the infrared light, the infrared receiver will receive
signals.

**Fritzing Circuit**
-------------------------
We can directly connect the pins of IR Obstacle Sensor Module
with the pins of Mega 2560 Board. The digital pin 2 is used to read the
signal of IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Module. We get the VCC of IR
Sensor Module connected to 5V, GND to GND, OUT to digital pin 2.

Uploaded the codes to the Mega2560 board, you can see the readings of
pins on the serial monitor. When IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Module
detects there is something covering ahead, there appears 「0」on the
serial monitor; otherwise,「1」is displayed. Refer to:ref:`1.4 Digital Read` 
to check the detail code explanation.
