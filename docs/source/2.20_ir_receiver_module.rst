2.20 IR Receiver Module
=========================

**Overview**
-------------

In this lesson, you will learn to use IR Receiver Module. IR Receiver is
a component with photocell that is tuned to receive to infrared light.
It is almost always used for remote control detection - every TV and DVD
player has one of these in the front to receive for the IR signal from
the clicker. Inside the remote control is a matching IR LED, which emits
IR pulses to tell the TV to turn on, off or change channels.

**Component Introduction**
----------------------------

An infrared-receiver is a component which receives infrared signals and
can independently receive infrared ray and output signals compatible
with TTL level. It's similar with a normal plastic-packaged transistor
in size and is suitable for all kinds of infrared remote control and
infrared transmission.

**Fritzing Circuit**
---------------------

In this example, we wire up the left pin (-) of IR Receiver Module to
GND, the middle pin to 5V, and the right pin (S) to pin 11.

**Code**
----------

The codes use the `library IRremote.h <https://github.com/sunfounder/sunfounder_vincent_kit_for_arduino/tree/master/library>`_, 
about how to import library,please refer to :ref:`4.1 Add Libraries`.

After uploading the codes to the Mega2560 board, you can see that the
current value of the pressed button of IR Remote Controller displays on
the serial monitor.

**Code Analysis**
---------------------

There are two important parts to notice in this program.

①The code uses an extra file decodeKeyValue.ino to decode the values in
class decode_result into key value.The file will be opened together with
the main file.

②IR Remote function is achieved by calling IRremote.h library related
functions.

.. code-block:: arduino

    #include <IRremote.h>

**Library Functions：**

.. code-block:: arduino

    IRrecv(int recvpin)

Create IRrecv object to control a IR Receiver module.

.. code-block:: arduino

    decode_result

In this kit, results are usually 8-digit hexadecimal numbers starting
with 00FF. You can check decodeKeyValue.ino file in the sample file.

.. code-block:: arduino

    void enableIRIn()

Initialize the IR receiver module.

.. code-block:: arduino

    int decode(decode_results *results);

Decodes the received IR message. Returns 0 if no data ready, 1 if data
ready. Results of decoding are stored in results.

.. code-block:: arduino

    void resume()

Restart for receiving an other value.
