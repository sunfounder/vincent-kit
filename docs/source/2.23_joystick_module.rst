2.23 Joystick Module
======================

**Overview**
--------------

In this lesson, you will learn something about Joystick. The basic idea
of a joystick is to translate the movement of a stick into electronic
information that a computer can process. It can be applied to work as
the controller of devices, such as robot.

**Components Required**

**Component Introduction**
---------------------------

In order to communicate a full range of motion to the computer, a
joystick needs to measure the stick's position on two axes -- the X-axis
(left to right) and the Y-axis (up and down). Just as in basic geometry,
the X-Y coordinates pinpoint the stick's position exactly.

To determine the location of the stick, the joystick control system
simply monitors the position of each shaft. The conventional analog
joystick design does this with two potentiometers, or variable
resistors.

The joystick also has a digital input that is actuated when the joystick
is pressed down.

**Fritzing Circuit**
---------------------

In this example, we get the GND of the Joystick extended to connect with
GND, VCC with 5V, VRX with pin A0. After that, we make VRY connect with
pin A1, SW connect with pin 8.

Uploaded the codes to the Mega2560 board, you can open the serial
monitor to see readings on the X-axis and Y-axis of Joystick, as well as
the button status of Z-axis. The values of the X-axis and Y-axis are the
analog values, which vary within the range「0」~「1023」. The Z-axis
shows numerical value and the state is either 「1」 or 「0」. Refer to
:ref:`1.5 Analog Read` and :ref:`1.4 Digital Read` to check the code
explanation.
