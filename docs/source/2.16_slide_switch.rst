2.16 Slide Switch
==================

**Overview**
------------

In this lesson, you will get to know something about Switch. A slide
switch, just as its name implies, is to slide the switch bar to connect
or break the circuit, and further switch circuits. The slide switch is
commonly used in low-voltage circuit. It has the features of flexibility
and stability, and applies in electric instruments and electric toys
widely.

How it works: Set the middle pin as the fixed one. When you pull the
slide to the left, the two pins on the left are connected; when you pull
it to the right, the two pins on the right are connected. Thus, it works
as a switch connecting or disconnecting circuits. See the figure below:

The circuit symbol of the slide switch is shown as below. The pin2 in
the figure refers to the middle pin.

**Fritzing Circuit**
---------------------

In this example, digital pin 2 is used to read the signal of Switch. In
addition, you need to connect a 10 kΩ resistor and a 104 capacitor in
parallel to form a RC circuit (Resistor - Capacitance circuit) which is
set between pin 2 and GND to realize debounce that may arise from your 
toggle of switch.

After the codes are uploaded to the Mega2560 board, you can open the
serial monitor to check the readings of the pin. When the Switch toggles
to the left, the serial monitor displays 「1」; when toggles to the
right, the serial monitor displays「0」. Refer to :ref:`1.4 Digital Read` to check the code explanation.
