2.25 Rotary Encoder Module
===========================

**Overview**
--------------

In this lesson, you will learn about Rotary Encoder. A rotary encoder is
an electronic switch with a set of regular pulses in strictly timing
sequence. When used with IC, it can achieve increment, decrement, page
turning and other operations such as mouse scrolling, menu selection,
and so on.

**Components Required**

**Component Introduction**
---------------------------

There are mainly two types of rotary encoders: absolute and incremental
(relative) encoders. An incremental one is used in this experiment.

Most rotary encoders have 5 pins with three functions of
turning left & right and pressing down. Pin 1 and pin 2 are switch
wiring terminals used to press. Pin 4 is generally connected to ground.
Pin 3 and pin 5 are first connected to a pull-up resistor and then to
VCC and they can generate two-phase square waves whose phase difference
is 90°. Usually these waves are called channel A and channel B as shown
below:

As shown on the right, when channel A changes from high level to low
level, if channel B is high level, it indicates the rotary encoder spins
clockwise (CW); if at that moment channel B is low level, it means spins
counterclockwise (CCW). So if we read the value of channel B when
channel A is low level, we can know in which direction the rotary
encoder rotates.

**Fritzing Circuit**
-----------------------

In this example, we can connect the Rotary Encoder pin directly to the
Mega 2560 Board pin, connect the GND of the Rotary Encoder to GND, 「+」
to 5V, SW to digital pin 4, DT to digital pin 3, and CLK to digital pin
2.

You will see the angular displacement of the rotary encoder
printed on Serial Monitor. When you turn the rotary encoder clockwise,
the angular displacement is increased; when turn it counterclockwise,
the displacement is decreased. If you press the switch on the rotary
encoder, the readings will return to zero.

**Code Analysis**
------------------

When Rotary Encoder is used, the following situations of pin level will
occur.

① When rotating the shaft, dtPin will go from high level to low level.

② clkPin will remain high level when the shaft rotates clockwise,
otherwise it goes low level.

③ When the shaft is pressed, swPin will have low level.

From this, the program flow is shown on the right.
