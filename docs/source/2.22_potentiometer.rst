2.22 Potentiometer
===================

**Overview**
-------------

In this lesson, you will learn about Potentiometer. Potentiometer is a
resistor component with 3 terminals and its resistance value can be
adjusted according to some regular variation.

**Components Required**

**Component Introduction**
---------------------------

Potentiometer usually consists of resistor and movable brush. When the
brush is moving along the resistor, there is a certain resistance or
voltage output depending on the displacement.

The functions of the potentiometer in the circuit are as follows:

1. **Serving as a voltage divider**

Potentiometer is a continuously adjustable resistor. When you adjust the
shaft or sliding handle of the potentiometer, the movable contact will
slide on the resistor. At this point, a voltage can be output depending
on the voltage applied onto the potentiometer and the angle the movable
arm has rotated to or the distance it moves.

2. **Serving as a rheostat**

When the potentiometer is used as a rheostat, connect the middle pin and
one of the other 2 pins in the circuit. Thus you can get a smoothly and
continuously changed resistance value cused by moving contact.

3. **Serving as a current controller**

When the potentiometer acts as a current controller, the sliding contact
terminal must be connected as one of the output terminals.

**Fritzing Circuit**

In this example, we use the analog pin (A0) to read the value
of the potentiometer. By rotating the axis of the potentiometer, you can
change the distribution of resistance among these three pins, changing
the voltage on the middle pin. When the resistance between the middle
and a outside pin connected to 5V is close to zero (and the resistance
between the middle and the other outside pin is close to 10kΩ), the
voltage at the middle pin is close to 5 V. The reverse operation (the
resistance between the middle and a outside pin connected to 5V is close
to 10kΩ) will make the voltage at the middle pin be close to 0V.

After uploading the codes to the Mega2560 board, you can open the serial
monitor to see the reading value of the pin. When rotating the axis of
the potentiometer, the serial port monitor will print the value
「0」~「1023」. For the detailed explanation of code, turn to check
