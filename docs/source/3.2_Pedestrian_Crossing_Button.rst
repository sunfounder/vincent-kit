3.2 Pedestrian Crossing Button
================================

**Overview**
-------------

When pedestrians cross the street, they just need to touch the button on
the lamppost of the roadside signal lamp, and the green light above the
traffic lane will turn into red then pedestrians can pass safely. Thus,
the hard situation of citizens crossing the street is comprehensively
resolved. At the same time, when there is no pedestrian to press, the
light above the lane that is set for vehicles to pass will always be
green, thus greatly improving the use efficiency of the road and traffic
capacity.

**Example Explanation**
-------------------------

The workflow of the project is as shown in the flow chart.
The function of number display of 7-Segment is realized by writing 8 bit
data into 74HC595. When there is a need of displaying「0」, the pins
abcdef of the segment display will be connected to the high level. The
pins, g and dp need to be connected to low level to
write「0x3f」(B00111111) in the codes. The complete codes for number
display of 7-Segment are as follows.
