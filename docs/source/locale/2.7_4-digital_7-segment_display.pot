msgid "The 4-digtal 7-segment display works independently. It uses the principle of human visual persistence to quickly display the characters of each 7-segment in a loop to form continuous strings."

#: ../2.7_4-digital_7-segment_display.rst:25
msgid "For example, when \"1234\" is displayed on the display, \"1\" is displayed on the first 7-segment, and \"234\" is not displayed. After a period of time, the second 7-segment shows \"2\", the 1st 3th 4th of 7-segment does not show, and so on, the four digital display show in turn. This process is very short (typically 5ms), and because of the optical afterglow effect and the principle of visual residue, we can see four characters at the same time."
