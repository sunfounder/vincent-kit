msgid "The access control system is the system that is used to control the entrance channel, which is developed on the basis of the traditional door lock. The traditional mechanical door lock is only a simple mechanical device, and no matter how reasonable the structural design is, how strong the material is, people can always open it through various means. The key to the entrance and exit (like an office building, a hotel room) is cumbersome. If the key is missed or replaced, the lock is to be replaced with the key. In order to solve these problems, the electronic magnetic card lock and the electronic coded lock are present, which has raised the management level of the access channel to a certain extent, and then the channel management enters into the electronic age."
