msgid "This sensor works by having a series of exposed traces connected to ground. Interlaced between the grounded traces are the sense traces."

#: ../2.29_water_sensor_module.rst:28
msgid "The sensor traces have a weak pull-up resistor of 1 MΩ. The resistor will pull the sensor trace value high until a drop of water shorts the sensor trace to the grounded trace."

msgid "The core part of water level sensor is an amplification circuit composed of a transistor and several comb-shape PCB cables. When placed in water, the comb-shape cable will change its resistance with the depth of the water and convert the depth signal into an electrical signal, and output analog value can directly be used in the program function, then to achieve the function of water level alarm."

msgid "After uploading the code to the Mega2560 board, you can open the serial monitor to see the read value of the pin. As the water level rises, the readings increase. Readings vary within the range 「0」~「1023」, but influenced by the environmental condition and the characteristics of water level sensor, the actual reading range may be smaller than the theoretical range. Refer to Part 1-1.5 Analog Read to check the detail code explanation."
