msgid "In this example, we read the signal of the button with the digital pin 2. When the button is not pressed, the digital pin 2 (through the drop-down resistor) is connected to ground to read the low level (0); when the button is pressed, the two pins are connected and when the pin is connected to the 5V power supply, the high level (1) is read."

msgid "If you disconnect the digital I/O pin from anything, the LED may blink erratically. The input is \"floating\" or it doesn't have a solid connection to voltage or ground, so it will randomly return either HIGH or LOW. That's why there needs a pull-down resistor in the circuit."
