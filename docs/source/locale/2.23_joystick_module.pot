msgid "In this lesson, you will learn something about Joystick. The basic idea of a joystick is to translate the movement of a stick into electronic information that a computer can process. It can be applied to work as the controller of devices, such as robot."

msgid "In order to communicate a full range of motion to the computer, a joystick needs to measure the stick's position on two axes -- the X-axis (left to right) and the Y-axis (up and down). Just as in basic geometry, the X-Y coordinates pinpoint the stick's position exactly."

msgid "To determine the location of the stick, the joystick control system simply monitors the position of each shaft. The conventional analog joystick design does this with two potentiometers, or variable resistors."

msgid "Uploaded the codes to the Mega2560 board, you can open the serial monitor to see readings on the X-axis and Y-axis of Joystick, as well as the button status of Z-axis. The values of the X-axis and Y-axis are the analog values, which vary within the range「0」~「1023」. The Z-axis shows numerical value and the state is either 「1」 or 「0」. Refer to :ref:`1.5 Analog Read` and :ref:`1.4 Digital Read` to check the code explanation."
