msgid "In this lesson, you will learn to use IR Receiver Module. IR Receiver is a component with photocell that is tuned to receive to infrared light. It is almost always used for remote control detection - every TV and DVD player has one of these in the front to receive for the IR signal from the clicker. Inside the remote control is a matching IR LED, which emits IR pulses to tell the TV to turn on, off or change channels."

msgid "An infrared-receiver is a component which receives infrared signals and can independently receive infrared ray and output signals compatible with TTL level. It's similar with a normal plastic-packaged transistor in size and is suitable for all kinds of infrared remote control and infrared transmission."
