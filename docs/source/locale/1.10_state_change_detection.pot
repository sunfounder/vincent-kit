msgid "When you use button, you can not only press down the button, light on the LED, release the button, turn off the LED, but also can switch the working state of the LED every time the button is pressed. In order to achieve this effect, you need to know when the state of the button changes from **off** to **on**, that is, \"state change detection\". In this lesson, we will print the results of state change detection of the button in the serial monitor."
