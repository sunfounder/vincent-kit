msgid "When using some switch input devices, some pull-up or pull-down resistors are often used to keep the level of corresponding pins at certain value on the condition that the device is not working. Such as in 1.4 Digital Read, a 10k resistor is used to make the pin be connected to GND under the condition that the button is not pressed down. If we have used a lot of switch input components and want to simplify the circuit, we can set the pin mode to「INPUT_PULLUP」in the code so that the pin reads the high level in the suspended state."

msgid "In this example, we use pin 2 to read the signal of button. The internal pull-up in pin 2 is valid, so if the button isn’t pressed, HIGH is read in pin 2; when the button is pressed, LOW is read."
