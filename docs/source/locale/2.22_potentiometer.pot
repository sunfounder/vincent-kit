msgid "Potentiometer is a continuously adjustable resistor. When you adjust the shaft or sliding handle of the potentiometer, the movable contact will slide on the resistor. At this point, a voltage can be output depending on the voltage applied onto the potentiometer and the angle the movable arm has rotated to or the distance it moves."

msgid "In this example, we use the analog pin (A0) to read the value of the potentiometer. By rotating the axis of the potentiometer, you can change the distribution of resistance among these three pins, changing the voltage on the middle pin. When the resistance between the middle and a outside pin connected to 5V is close to zero (and the resistance between the middle and the other outside pin is close to 10kΩ), the voltage at the middle pin is close to 5 V. The reverse operation (the resistance between the middle and a outside pin connected to 5V is close to 10kΩ) will make the voltage at the middle pin be close to 0V."
