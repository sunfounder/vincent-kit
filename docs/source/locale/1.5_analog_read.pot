msgid "You can use the analogRead() command to read analog input from the physical world through an analog pin, which is suitable for analog input elements such as potentiometers, photoresistance, water level detection sensors, and so on. This article will take the potentiometer as an example to read the analog value of its output."

msgid "The Arduino have a circuit inside called an analog-to-digital converter or ADC that reads this changing voltage and converts it to a number between 0 and 1023. When the shaft is turned all the way in one direction, there are 0 volts going to the pin, and the input value is 0. When the shaft is turned all the way in the opposite direction, there are 5 volts going to the pin and the input value is 1023. In between, analogRead() returns a number between 0 and 1023 that is proportional to the amount of voltage being applied to the pin."
