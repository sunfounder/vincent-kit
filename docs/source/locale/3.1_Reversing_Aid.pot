msgid "In this project, we need to avoid the interference between the LCD screen and the alarm system as much as possible (for example, the LED flicker time is too long and the LCD refresh is delayed), so please avoid using the delay() statement and use two separate intervals to control the working frequency of the LCD and alarm system respectively. Its workflow is shown in the flow chart. For analysis of Interval function, refer to :ref:`1.11 Interval`"
