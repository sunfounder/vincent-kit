msgid "In this example, we use digital pins 2~11 to drive the LED Bar Graph. LED Bar Graph has ten separate LEDs inside and each LED has two pins. The left pins 1~10 of LED Bar Graph are connected with the digital pins 2~11 respectively; the right side pins 11~20 are separately extended to same side of these 220ohm resistors whose other sides are identically connected to GND."
