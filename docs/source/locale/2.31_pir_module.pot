msgid "In this lesson, you will learn how to use PIR Module. The PIR sensor detects infrared heat radiation or the presence of organisms that emit infrared heat radiation. This module is widely used in daily life for our intruder alarm and visiting prompt."

msgid "The PIR sensor is split into two slots that are connected to a differential amplifier. Whenever a stationary object is in front of the sensor, the two slots receive the same amount of radiation and the output is zero. Whenever a moving object is in front of the sensor, one of the slots receives more radiation than the other, which makes the output fluctuate high or low. This change in output voltage is a result of detection of motion."

#: ../2.31_pir_module.rst:32
msgid "After the sensing module is wired, there is a one-minute initialization. During the initialization, module will output for 0~3 times at intervals. Then the module will be in the standby mode. Please keep the interference of light source and other sources away from the surface of the module so as to avoid the misoperation caused by the interfering signal. Even you'd better use the module without too much wind, because the wind can also interfere with the sensor. Two trigger modes: (choosing different modes by using the jumper cap)."

msgstr ""

#: ../2.31_pir_module.rst:47
msgid "Turning the knob of the distance adjustment potentiometer clockwise, the range of sensing distance increases, and the maximum sensing distance range is about 0-7 meters. If turn it anticlockwise, the range of sensing distance is reduced, and the minimum sensing distance range is about 0-3 meters."

msgid "**Delay Adjustment**"
msgstr ""

#: ../2.31_pir_module.rst:58
msgid "Rotate the knob of the delay adjustment potentiometer clockwise, you can also see the sensing delay increasing. The maximum of the sensing delay can reach up to 300s. On the contrary, if rotate it anticlockwise, you can shorten the delay with a minimum of 5s."

msgid "**H:** **Repeatable trigger mode**, after sensing the human body, the module outputs high level. During the subsequent delay period, if somebody enters the sensing range,the output will keep being the high level."
msgstr ""

#: ../2.31_pir_module.rst:67
msgid "**L**\\ ：\\ **Non-repeatable trigger mode**, outputs high level when it senses the human body. After the delay, the output will change from high level into low level automatically."

msgid "PIR can only be installed indoors, and its false alarm rate has a great relationship with the location and mode of installation. The correct use should meet the following conditions:"

msgid "4. Don't face straightly toward the window, otherwise the disturbance of the hot air flow outside the window and the movement of people will cause false alarm."

msgid "5. Do not use in areas with strong airflow."

#: ../2.31_pir_module.rst:86
msgid "6. The sensitivity of PIR to human body is also closely related to the direction of movement. It is least sensitive to radial movement and most sensitive to the movement in the crosscutting direction."
