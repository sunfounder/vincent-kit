msgid "Guessing Numbers is a fun party game where you and your friends take turns inputting a number (0~99). The range will be smaller with the inputting of the number till a player answers the riddle correctly. Then the player is defeated and punished. For example, if the lucky number is 51 which the players cannot see, and the player ① inputs 50, the prompt of number range changes to 50~99; if the player ② inputs 70, the range of number can be 50~70; if the player ③ inputs 51, he or she is the unlucky one. Here, we use IR Remote Controller to input numbers and use LCD to output outcomes."
