msgid "In this lesson, you will learn how to use RFID Module. RFID is the abbreviation of Radio Frequency Identification. Its working principle is to carry on the contactless data communication between the reader and the label to achieve the goal of identifying the target. The application of RFID is very extensive, currently the typical applications are animal chips, immobilizer, access control, parking control, production chain automation, material management and so on."

msgid "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) refers to technologies that involve using wireless communication between an object (or tag) and an interrogating device (or reader) to automatically track and identify such objects. The tag transmission range is limited to several meters from the reader. A clear line of sight between the reader and tag is not necessarily required."
msgstr ""

#: ../2.35_rfid-rc522_module.rst:30
msgid "Most tags contain at least one integrated circuit (IC) and an antenna. The microchip stores information and is responsible for managing the radio frequency (RF) communication with the reader. Passive tags do not have an independent energy source and depend on an external electromagnetic signal, provided by the reader, to power their operations. Active tags contain an independent energy source, such as a battery. Thus, they may have increased processing, transmission capabilities and range."

msgid "MFRC522 also supports MIFARE series of high-speed non-contact communication, with a two-way data transmission rate up to 424kbit/s. As a new member of the 13.56MHz highly integrated reader card series, MF RC522 is much similar to the existing MF RC500 and MF RC530 but there also exists great differences."
