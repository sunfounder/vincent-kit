msgid "The digitalWrite() statement here is used to write high level or low level to pins and to let LED and active buzzer 「work 」or 「stop」. In this lesson, we will take LED as an example to introduce the experiment phenomenon."

msgid "Here, we connect the LED to the digital pin 9, so we need to declare an int variable called ledpin at the beginning of the program and assign a value of 9."

msgid "Now, initialize the pin in the setup() function, where you need to initialize the pin to OUTPUT mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../1.2_digital_write.rst:75
msgid "In loop(), digitalWrite() is used to provide 5V high level signal for ledpin, which will cause voltage difference between LED pins and light LED up."
msgstr ""

#: ../1.2_digital_write.rst:82
msgid "If the level signal is changed to LOW, the ledPin's signal will be returned to 0 V to turn LED off."

#: ../1.2_digital_write.rst:88
msgid "An interval between on and off is required to allow people to see the change, so we use a delay(1000) code to let the controller do nothing for 1000 ms."
