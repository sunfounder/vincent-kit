2.18 Touch Switch Module
========================

**Overview**
------------

In this lesson, you will learn about touch switch module. It can replace
the traditional kinds of switch with these advantages: convenient
operation, fine touch sense, precise control and least mechanical wear.

**Component Introduction**
---------------------------

Touch switch module works by detecting a change in capacitance due to
influence of an external object. The touch plate is covered with
insulating material, and the user does not come in contact with the
electrical circuit.

A capacitive touch switch has different layers—top insulating face plate
followed by touch plate, another insulating layer and then ground plate.

In practice, a capacitive sensor can be made on a
double-sided PCB by regarding one side as the touch sensor and the
opposite side as ground plate of the capacitor. When power is applied
across these plates, the two plates get charged. In equilibrium state,
the plates have the same voltage as the power source.

The touch detector circuit has an oscillator whose frequency is
dependent on capacitance of the touchpad. When a finger is moved close
to the touchpad, additional capacitance causes frequency of this
internal oscillator to change. The detector circuit tracks oscillator
frequency at timed intervals, and when the shift crosses the threshold
change, the circuit triggers a key-press event.

Uploaded the codes to the Mega2560 board, you can see the readings of
pins displaying on the serial monitor.

When your finger tip touches the Touch switch module, 「1」will be
displayed on the serial monitor; and when you remove your finger, 「0」
will be be displayed. As for the detailed code explanation, you need to
turn to :ref:`1.4 Digital Read`.
