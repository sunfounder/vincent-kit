3.5 Access Control System
==========================

**Overview**
------------

The access control system is the system that is used to control the
entrance channel, which is developed on the basis of the traditional
door lock. The traditional mechanical door lock is only a simple
mechanical device, and no matter how reasonable the structural design
is, how strong the material is, people can always open it through
various means. The key to the entrance and exit (like an office
building, a hotel room) is cumbersome. If the key is missed or replaced,
the lock is to be replaced with the key. In order to solve these
problems, the electronic magnetic card lock and the electronic coded
lock are present, which has raised the management level of the access
channel to a certain extent, and then the channel management enters into
the electronic age.

**Fritzing Circuit**
-----------------------

In this example, Power Supply Module is used to power the breadboard. We
get the GND of Mega 2560 Board connected to the cathode rail of the
breadboard, GND of ULN2003 to the cathode rail of the breadboard, VCC to
5V OUTPUT of Power Supply and the Stepper Motor to OUT1-OUT5 of ULN.

**Example Explanation**
--------------------------

The workflow of the access control system is shown in the flow chart.

When there is no authorized ID identified (the variable “Approved”
equals to 0), the device will perform functions of ID identification and
password identification.

If the authorized ID is identified (“Approved” equals to 1), the door
will open. After that, the door will be closed a few seconds later and
the identified status will be reset (“Approved” equals to 0).

In addition to the core access control function, the project also uses
LCD and active buzzer to complete the work of the user interaction
system of the access control system.
