1.3 Analog Write
================

Overview
--------

You can write the PWM wave to the pin by using analogWrite(). This
method can be used to adjust the brightness of LED, change the color of
RGB, or adjust the motor speed, etc. Here we will take LED as an example
to get gradient brightness of LED.

Fritzing Circuit
----------------

In this example, we use the PWM pin 9 to drive the LED. Connect one end
of the resistor to pin 9. Connect the long pin (anode) of the LED to the
other end of the resistor. Connect the short pin (negative, referred to
as the cathode) of LED to GND. 

.. note::
    PWM pins of Mega2560 board are 2 -13, 44 - 46.

After uploading the code to the Mega2560 board, you can see that the LED
gradually brightens out and turns off gradually.

Code Analysis
-------------

Declare pin 9 as ledPin.

.. code-block:: arduino

    int ledPin = 9; 

analogWrite() in loop() assigns ledPin an analog value (PWM wave) between 0 and 255 to change the brightness of LED.

.. code-block:: arduino

    analogWrite(ledPin, value);

Using a for loop, the value of analogWrite() can be changed step by step between the minimum value (0) and the maximum value (255).

.. code-block:: arduino

    for (int value = 0 ; value <= 255; value += 5) {
        analogWrite(ledPin, value);
    }

In order to see the experimental phenomenon clearly, a delay(30) needs to be added to the for cycle to control the brightness change time.

.. code-block:: arduino

    void loop() {
    for (int value = 0 ; value <= 255; value += 5) {
        analogWrite(ledPin, value);
        delay(30);
    }
    }
