2.29 Water Sensor Module
=========================

**Overview**
--------------

In this lesson, you will learn how to use a water sensor module. A water
sensor module is designed for water detection, which can be widely used
in sensing the rainfall, water level, even the liquid leakage.

This sensor works by having a series of exposed traces connected to
ground. Interlaced between the grounded traces are the sense traces.

The sensor traces have a weak pull-up resistor of 1 MΩ. The resistor
will pull the sensor trace value high until a drop of water shorts the
sensor trace to the grounded trace.

This item can judge the water level through with a series of exposed
parallel wires stitch to measure the water droplet/water size.

The core part of water level sensor is an amplification circuit composed
of a transistor and several comb-shape PCB cables. When placed in water,
the comb-shape cable will change its resistance with the depth of the
water and convert the depth signal into an electrical signal, and output
analog value can directly be used in the program function, then to
achieve the function of water level alarm.

**Fritzing Circuit**
------------------------

In this example, we directly connect the pins of Water Sensor Module to
pins of Mega 2560 Board. We use analog A0 to get the value of Water
Sensor Module, and get the pin「S」of Water Sensor Module to A0, 「-」to
GND, 「+」to 5V.

After uploading the code to the Mega2560 board, you can open the serial
monitor to see the read value of the pin. As the water level rises, the
readings increase. Readings vary within the range 「0」~「1023」, but
influenced by the environmental condition and the characteristics of
water level sensor, the actual reading range may be smaller than the
theoretical range. Refer to Part 1-1.5 Analog Read to check the detail
code explanation.
