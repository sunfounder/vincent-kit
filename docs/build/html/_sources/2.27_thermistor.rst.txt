2.27 Thermistor
===============

**Overview**
-------------

In this lesson, you will learn how to use thermistor. Thermistor can be
used as electronic circuit components for temperature compensation of
instrument circuits. In the current meter, flowmeter, gas analyzer, and
other devices. It can also be used for overheating protection,
contactless relay, constant temperature, automatic gain control, motor
start, time delay, color TV automatic degaussing, fire alarm and
temperature compensation.

Thermistor is a sensitive element, and it has two types:
Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) and Positive Temperature
Coefficient (PTC), also known as NTC and PTC. Its resistance varies
significantly with temperature. The resistance of PTC thermistor
increases with temperature ,while the condition of NTC is opposite to
the former. In this experiment we use NTC.

The principle is that the resistance of the NTC thermistor changes with
the temperature of the outer environment. It detects the real-time
temperature of the environment. When the temperature gets higher, the
resistance of the thermistor decreases. Then the voltage data is
converted to digital quantities by the A/D adapter. The temperature in
Celsius or Fahrenheit is output via programming.

In this experiment, a thermistor and a 10k pull-up resistor are used.
Each thermistor has a normal resistance. Here it is 10k ohm, which is
measured under 25 degree Celsius.

Here is the relation between the resistance and temperature:

R\ :sub:`T` =R\ :sub:`N` exp\ :sup:`B(1/TK – 1/TN)`

**R\ T** is the resistance of the NTC thermistor when the temperature is
**T\ K**.

**R\ N** is the resistance of the NTC thermistor under the rated
temperature **T\ N**. Here, the numerical value of **R\ N** is 10k.

**T\ K** is a Kelvin temperature and the unit is K. Here, the numerical
value of **T\ K**\ is 273.15 + degree Celsius.

**T\ N** is a rated Kelvin temperature; the unit is K too. Here, the
numerical value of **T\ N** is 273.15+25.

And **B**\ (beta), the material constant of NTC thermistor, is also
called heat sensitivity index with a numerical value 3950.

**exp** is the abbreviation of exponential, and the base number e is a
natural number and equals 2.7 approximately.

Convert this formula
T\ :sub:`K`\ =1/(ln(R\ :sub:`T`/R\ :sub:`N`)/B+1/T\ :sub:`N`) to get
Kelvin temperature that minus 273.15 equals degree Celsius.

This relation is an empirical formula. It is accurate only when the
temperature and resistance are within the effective range.

**Fritzing Circuit**
----------------------

In this example, we use the analog pin A0 to get the value of
Thermistor. One pin of thermistor is connected to 5V, and the other is
wired up to A0. At the same time, a 10kΩ resistor is connected with the
other pin before connecting to GND.

After uploading the code to the Mega2560 board, you can open the serial
monitor to check the current temperature. The Kelvin temperature is
calculated according to the formula
**T\ K\ =1/(ln(R\ T/R\ N)/B+1/T\ N).**
