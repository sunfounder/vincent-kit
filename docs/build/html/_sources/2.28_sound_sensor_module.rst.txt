2.28 Sound Sensor Module
=========================

**Overview**
------------

In this lesson, you will learn how to use a sound sensor module. The
sound sensor module provides an easy way to detect sound and is
generally used for detecting sound intensity.

This module can be used for security, switch, and monitoring
applications. Its accuracy can be easily adjusted for the convenience of
usage.

It uses a microphone which supplies the input to an amplifier, peak
detector and buffer. When the sensor detects a sound, it processes an
output signal voltage which is sent to a micro-controller then performs
necessary processing.

This module has two outputs:

① AO: analog output, real-time output voltage signal of microphone.

② DO: when the intensity of the sound reaches a certain threshold, the
output is a high or low level signal. The threshold sensitivity can be
achieved by adjusting the potentiometer.


**Fritzing Circuit**
-----------------------

In this example, we can directly connect the pin of Sound
Sensor Module to the pin of Mega 2560 Board, connect the pin「G」 of
Sound Sensor Module to GND, the pin 「+」to 5V, AO to analog pin A0, and
D0 to digital pin 2.

After uploading the code to the Mega2560 board, you can open the serial
monitor to see the read value of the pin. When the ambient sound gets
louder, the digital reading is 「1」 (adjust the potentiometer of the
module to modify the threshold to trigger the high level), and the
reading value of the analog pin will change significantly; when the
environment is quiet, the digital reading is 「0」 and the analog
reading changes smoothly.

The range of analog reading is「0」~「1023」, but influenced by the the
environmental condition and the characteristics of sound sensor, the
actual reading range may be smaller than the theoretical one. If an
oscilloscope is used, the changing of analog reading of the sound sensor
will be more obvious.

About the detail code explanation, refer to :ref:`1.5 Analog Read` and
:ref:`1.4 Digital Read`.
