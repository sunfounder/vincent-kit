2.5 7-Segment Display
======================

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will learn something about 7-Segment Display. 7-Segment Display has so many advantages that it is widely used in electrical equipments, especially in household appliances that display numerical information, such as display, air conditioner, water heater, refrigerator and so on. LEDs on the 7-Segment Display emit light by the input of different electrical signals to the different pins of it. The numerical information it can display includes time, date, temperature and so on.

Component Introduction

A 7-segment display is an 8-shaped component which packages 7 LEDs. Each
LED is called a segment – when energized, one segment forms part of a
numeral to be displayed.

There are two types of pin connection: Common Cathode (CC) and Common
Anode (CA). As the name suggests, a CC display has all the cathodes of
the 7 LEDs connected when a CA display has all the anodes of the 7
segments connected. In this kit, we use the former.

Each of the LEDs in the display is given a positional segment with one
of its connection pins led out from the rectangular plastic package.
These LED pins are labeled from "a" through to "g" representing each
individual LED. The other LED pins are connected together forming a
common pin. So by forward biasing the appropriate pins of the LED
segments in a particular order, some segments will brighten and others
stay dim, thus showing the corresponding character on the display.

Fritzing Circuit

Connect each of pin a-g of the 7-Segment Display to one
220ohm current limiting resistor respectively and then to pin 4–11. GND
connects to GND.

The wiring between the 7-segment display and the Mega2560 board as shown

Once upload the codes, you can see the 7-segment display displaying 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, b, C, d, E, F in sequence. 

Code Analysis
-------------

Take the pin numbers on 7-segment as names, and declare the pins on the Mega2560 board.  

.. code-block:: arduino

    const int a=7; //a of 7-segment attach to digital pin 7
    const int b=6; //b of 7-segment attach to digital pin 6
    const int c=5; //c of 7-segment attach to digital pin 5
    const int d=11;//d of 7-segment attach to digital pin 11
    const int e=10;//e of 7-segment attach to digital pin 10
    const int f=8;//f of 7-segment attach to digital pin 8
    const int g=9;//g of 7-segment attach to digital pin 9
    const int dp=4;//dp of 7-segment attach to digital pin 4

Install a series of subfunctions to package the level state at each
block during the number display of the 7-segment. For example, when the
character 「2」 is displayed, the block F and the block c are turn off;
the other blocks are lit up.

First we need to know how it looks like when display the numeral **2**
on the 7-Segment display. It's actually the segments a, b, d, e and g
are power on, which generates the display of **2**. In programming, pins
connected to these segments are set High level when c and f are Low
level. Here we use a *for()* statement to set these pins as High level
respectively (the braces after *for()* are deleted as there is only one
line). Connect pin dp to pin 4; it's already defined as LOW in
*setup()*.

After running this part, the 7-segment will display **2**. Similarly,
the display of other characters are the same. Since the letters b and d
in upper case, namely **B** and **D**, would look the same with **8**
and **0** on the display, they are displayed in lower case instead.

.. code-block:: arduino

    ...
    void digital_2(void) //diaplay 2 to the 7-segment
    {
    digitalWrite(b,HIGH);
    digitalWrite(a,HIGH);
    for(int j = 9;j <= 11;j++)
    digitalWrite(j,LOW);
    digitalWrite(c,LOW);
    digitalWrite(f,LOW);
    }
    ... 

In loop(), call the function that displays the number.

.. code-block:: arduino

    void loop()
    {
    digital_1();//diaplay 1 to the 7-segment
    delay(1000);//wait for a second
    digital_2();//diaplay 2 to the 7-segment
    delay(1000); //wait for a second
    digital_3();//diaplay 3 to the 7-segment
    //... 
    }
